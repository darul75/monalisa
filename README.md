### Help

If while building you get that kind of error 'Wrong JPEG library version: library is 90, caller expects 80.', here is what I have done:

cd /usr/local/include
sudo rm jpeglib.h
cd /usr/local/lib
sudo rm libjpeg*.*

Then everything it fine. Under Mavericks OS

### Build

You can run the tests by running

```
npm install
```
or
```
npm test
```

assuming you already have `grunt` installed, otherwise you also need to do:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
